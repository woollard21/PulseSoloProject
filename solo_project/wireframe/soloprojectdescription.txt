Solo Project

Name: Pulse

Description: Project idea is for students in junior high and highschool in a local youth group. You will be able to see posts, sermons, notifications, updates, and possibly able to buy merch.
Additionally students will have the option of creating an account so that they can post questions they may have or other insprining information and hopefully other students (and leaders) will be able to comment and like these posts. This idea came about as a way for these students who usually don't have cell phones, have a safe and effective way to communicate in which their parents feel safe letting them use.
